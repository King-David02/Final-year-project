This project solves the issue of traffic congestion by using computer vision to control traffic instead of conventional methods like hard coded timers, traffic wardens etc. YOLO v8n Model is used to detect vehicles on each lane, count the vehicles and give green time dynamically based on the number of vehicles on each lane. The YOLO v8n model was also trained on custom accident detection dataset to alert appropriate authorities in the occurance of accident in each lane. The alert is sent using a Telegram bot. A raspberry pi 4b is used in this project which serves as the brain of the project.
